# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
dat <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
#seperating to rows using different versions of linebreak string
dat <- dat %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>") %>% 
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<b4/>")



#To exlude the words describing the amounts I split the string into words
temp <- as.data.frame(str_split_fixed(dat$ingredients, ' ', n = Inf))
table(temp$V2)
table(temp$V1)

#I exclude the first two words; they always contain amounts
temp <- temp[,3:8]
table(temp$V3)

#I Create ID to be able to arrange back the lines later to their original order
temp[,7] <- 1:nrow(temp)

#I create data-frames containing problematic and non-problematic rows
oz <- filter(temp, V3 == "oz")
non_oz <- filter(temp, V3 != "oz")

#I delete the problematic words
oz <- oz[,2:7]

#Merge and rearrance the words into one dataframe
oz[,7] <- NA
oz <- oz[, c(1,2,3,4,5,7,6)]
names(oz) <- names(non_oz)
temp <- bind_rows(oz, non_oz)
temp <- arrange(temp, V7.1)

#Paste the words into strings
test <- with(temp, paste(V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, sep = " "))
test <- gsub("NA", "", test)

#Substitute the original strings
dat$ingredients <- test



#delete alchohol content indicator
dat$ingredients <- gsub("\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)","",as.character(dat$ingredients))



#delete extra white spaces
dat$ingredients <- trimws(dat$ingredients)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients <- names(table(dat$ingredients))
ingredients
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
num_of_ingredients <- length(ingredients)
num_of_ingredients
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
ingredient_numbers <- as.data.frame(table(dat$ingredients))
names(ingredient_numbers) <- c("Name", "times_used")
ingredient_numbers <- arrange(ingredient_numbers, times_used)
tenth <- ingredient_numbers[(nrow(ingredient_numbers)-9), 2]
frequent <- filter(ingredient_numbers, times_used >= 6)
frequent <- frequent[,1]
frequent
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
dat <- dat %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(number_of_ingredients = n()) %>% 
  ungroup()

max(dat$number_of_ingredients)

fancy <- filter(dat, number_of_ingredients == 6)

unique(fancy$name)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
#Assuming that every ingredient is listed once within one recipe
all_ingredients <- as.data.frame(table(dat$ingredients))
names(all_ingredients) <- c("Name", "times_used")
unique_ingredients <- filter(all_ingredients, times_used == 1)
nrow(unique_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
unique_cocktail <- dat[dat$ingredients %in% unique_ingredients$Name, ]
unique(unique_cocktail$name)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
'%!in%' <- function(x,y)!('%in%'(x,y))

common_cocktail <- dat[dat$name %!in% unique_cocktail$name, ]
unique(common_cocktail$name)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}
cocktails <- unique(dat$name)
req_ingredients <- unique(dat$ingredients)
cheatsheet <- matrix(1:(length(cocktails)*length(ingredients)), nrow = 55, dimnames = list(cocktails, ingredients))
```

```{r}
for (i in 1:length(cocktails)){
  for (j in 1:length(ingredients)){
    if (as.data.frame(dim(filter(dat, name == cocktails[[i]] & ingredients == req_ingredients[[j]])))[1,1] == 0){
      cheatsheet[i,j] <- ""}
    else {
      cheatsheet[i,j] <- "X"
      }
    }
}
cheatsheet
```



Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
