## Introduction

In the chosen data table you can find statistics about NFL players. Every row contains data about one player in one match. My goal in this analysis is to create two plots and two regression models. To decide what my hypotheses and interest should be, lets explore the data!

```{r cars}
#Read the csv
raw <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-08-28/nfl_2010-2017.csv")[,-1]

view(raw)
#It was read in properly
```

## Data exploration

First I will check whether the data is what I think it is (variables look as they should look).
```{r}

##Date
hist(raw$game_year)
#There is a bump in the first column
table(raw$game_year)
#In the table you can see it is not problematic, probably the low number of breaks caused the problem
hist(raw$game_year, 25)
#better
```

Teams
```{r}
teams <- as.data.frame(table(raw$team))
view(teams)
```

There are more teams than there are currently in the NFL due to name changes (SD is LAC now; STL is LA now; OAK is LV today (I don't need to change if because they changed their name after 2017, but I do it anyway); JAC is the same as JAX, only the abb. changed)
Lets change it accordingly, in my following analyses continuity in franchises will be an important factor.

```{r}
raw <- raw %>%
  mutate(team = as.factor(case_when(team == "SD" ~ "LAC",
                                    team == "STL" ~ "LA",
                                    team == "OAK" ~ "LV",
                                    team == "JAC" ~ "JAX",
                                    TRUE ~ team)
                          )
         )
teams <- as.data.frame(table(raw$team))
view(teams)
```

Name
```{r}
#Look for reading mistakes
raw[which.max(nchar(raw$name)), "name"]
raw[which.min(nchar(raw$name)), "name"]
#Looks OK
```

Position
```{r}
table(raw$position)
```
There is enough data to analyze any position, I will check the corresponding performance metrics once I pick the position of interest

The variable which can be used as an outcome measure the best is rate (avg ratings of the player in the match), so I check that
```{r}
view(raw$rate)
sum(is.na(raw$rate))
hist(raw$rate, 1000)
```
There is a curiously high coloumn at 0 and somewhere around 40. Will need to check it.
The number of missing data is high (71044). I check whether it it similar in each position

```{r}
rated <- raw %>%
  filter(is.na(rate) == FALSE)

table(rated$position)
```
All of the QBs have ratings. I check whether the key performance mertics are filled out.
```{r}
qb <- rated %>%
  filter(position == "QB")
#Number of pass attempts
sum(is.na(qb$pass_att))
#Passed yards
sum(is.na(qb$pass_yds))
#Number of touchdown passes
sum(is.na(qb$pass_tds))
#Number of interceptions (when the pass is stolen by the opposing team)
sum(is.na(qb$int))
#Number of times the QB is tackled while having a ball in his hand (usually does not count as his fault)
sum(is.na(qb$sck))
#Number of times the ball gets stolen shortly before the QB releases the ball suring the passing movement
sum(is.na(qb$pass_fumbles))
```
The most important metrics contain 0 missing value which is great. There are some less important coloumns, but for some QBs they should be accounted for (depends on the player's style) 
```{r}
#Number of rush attempts
sum(is.na(qb$rush_att))
#Rushed yards
sum(is.na(qb$rush_yds))
#Number of touchdown rushes
sum(is.na(qb$rush_tds))
#AVerage rush distance
sum(is.na(qb$rush_avg))
#Number of times the ball gets stolen mid rush
sum(is.na(qb$rush_fumbles))
```
The number of missing values is the same in every case (1444) so probably they are missing in the same rows. I choose to exclude those rows to get a full picture about the QBs in my analysed sample

```{r}
#Choose cols if interest
qb <- qb %>%
  select(1:9, 15:21)

#Choose complete cases
qb <- qb[complete.cases(qb),]
```
More rows disappeared, but every remaining column need to be complete, and the number of coloumns is still enough
I check the distribution of the ratings again
```{r}
hist(qb$rate, 1000)
```
It looks much better, but I will need exclude the outliers (there are spikes at the end).

I use the 1.5*IQR criterion 
```{r}
qb_trimmed <- qb %>%
  filter(rate > quantile(qb$rate)[[2]] - 1.5*IQR(qb$rate) & 
         rate < quantile(qb$rate)[[3]] + 1.5*IQR(qb$rate))
hist(qb_trimmed$rate, 1000)
```
The distribution has a weird tale approaching 0, but otherwise looks great

##Hypotheses
In this analysis I intend to explore what performance metrics can efficiently predics the ratings of the Quarterbacks (QBs). This question is not unique probably, because QBs are in the focus of the game and many fans think that the QB is the player who is mainly responsible for the success of the team. Sadly I can not test that hypothesis since I have no data available about the outcome of the games. I choose my research question to help the QBs of tomorrow. If they know what metrics (skills) they have to pay attention to have a higher rating they will have a greater chance to be drafted or be the crowd favorite.

First, I will build a model (m1) that contains only the key QB metrics (pass_yds, pass_tds, int). Second, I will build a model (m2) that contains the metrics that is caintained by m1 and I add the metrics hybrid players are known for (rush_yds, rush_avg, rush_tds, rush_fumbles). Finally, I will test the better model in a  multilevel model to check whether franchises are an influential factor.

##Ploting
Before I start to test my hypotheses I produce two plots. 
























Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
